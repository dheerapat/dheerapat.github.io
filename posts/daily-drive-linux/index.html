<p>Getting software to work on Windows is an easy task: just click an installer, click the next button, let the installation bar run to 100%, and boom, you’ve installed software on a Windows machine. But when it comes to &lsquo;development tools&rsquo; such as Docker, compilers, Kubernetes, etc., you will find that installing these tools on Windows is quite complex and not so straightforward.</p>
<p>That’s why I chose Linux as my daily driver OS on my personal and work laptop for almost 5 years now. After careful consideration, I personally think that every developer should know how to use Linux.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-linux-distro">My First Linux Distro</h3>
<p>I installed my first Linux on my computer around 2014, when I was just a high school boy. The OS I chose back in the day was Ubuntu version 14, if I remember correctly. Back then, configuring the machine to work as a normal laptop was quite challenging because the Linux community in Thailand was not very strong, and all the information was in English, which I wasn’t good at yet. So, I switched back to Windows after trying the OS for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020, and I wanted to tinker around with my computer and just started to learn programming. I noticed that Windows did not provide the smoothest developer experience. I had to navigate complex settings to enable features and configure paths correctly. I wanted my computer to just work after setting it up. For example, I wanted to download some binary, type <code>./&lt;binary-name&gt;</code>, and have the program show up right away without any additional settings or installations.</p>
<h3 id="distro-hopping">Distro Hopping</h3>
<p>So I started migrating my computer environment to Linux again after 6 years, and now everything is so much easier with Linux. I tried <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> first because it is a well-known distro. After around 6 months, I switched to <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS</a> and stuck with it for a year. Then, I switched to <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en">RHEL</a> as I wanted to know what an enterprise-grade distro felt like. I liked it because it was stable and well-structured, but it lacked some bleeding-edge software support. So, I switched to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora 38</a>, and now this is the main Linux distro that I use daily. I don’t think I will switch to another distro anytime soon.</p>
<h3 id="why-i-choose-fedora">Why I Choose Fedora</h3>
<p>It’s the community. I like to use a distro that has a large community or user base so developers will test the software against it the most, like Ubuntu or Fedora. I don’t want to use some exotic distro with a minimal user base and encounter problems that someone asked about in community boards 5 years ago with a reply like &ldquo;already fixed, thank you.&rdquo; So, choosing the right distro matters.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-the-challenge">Embrace the Challenge</h3>
<p>When you choose Linux, you have to make a commitment. It’s not easy at first, but it will be rewarding once you get the hang of it. 99% of servers in this world run Linux, but only 5% use it in consumer computers. So, you will have less competition in terms of opportunities. I recommend you, developer fellas, to try out Linux. You will find that flexibility and openness are what make this software so great. I will write more blogs about how to get started with Linux in upcoming posts.</p>
