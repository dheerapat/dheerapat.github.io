<p>Hi, internet wanderer. My name is Dheeto. I am an ex-pharmacist currently working as a software engineer in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
<p>You might wonder, &ldquo;How come?&rdquo; I ended up in software engineering. Well, let me explain it to you.</p>
<h3 id="first-few-years-of-my-career">First Few Years of My Career</h3>
<p>I graduated from pharmacy school in early 2020, the year that COVID-19 hit. The healthcare industry wasn&rsquo;t affected that much, so I could still find a job pretty easily and worked as a laboratory technician for almost three years.</p>
<p>I chose to be a laboratory technician because, despite having a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree that allows me to dispense dangerous medicine to patients, I felt like working in a hospital or drug store was my kryptonite. People management, sales targets, and customer satisfaction were things I didn&rsquo;t like. So, I preferred to work as a lab rat instead.</p>
<h3 id="burnout">Burnout</h3>
<p>Time went by. Two years passed, and then I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t contributing anything to the world. My job was a day-to-day routine: working as per the standard operation procedures and going home after office hours. But something in my head kept telling me, &ldquo;Is this the life you want? Do you want to stay like this for the rest of your life?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Hell no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have always been passionate about technology and computer science, especially space-related computer science. So, around the end of 2022, I decided I wanted a different job and started learning a new domain of interest. I signed up for many online courses like Codecademy, LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, and many more until I found a hidden gem, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">freeCodeCamp</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-day-when-it-all-started">The Day When It All Started</h3>
<p>I took a back-end development course on this website, and it changed me forever. Many people with self-taught experience will know that when you start learning with online courses, you will reach a point called &rsquo;tutorial hell,&rsquo; where you can&rsquo;t start your own project without any tutorial video or example. But after I finished this course from freeCodeCamp, I became a somewhat baby-level junior developer. I could read documentation on various frameworks, start my own projects without any video tutorials, and fix problems that occurred just by reading documentation and GitHub issues.</p>
<p>Around this time, I finally secured a new job as a junior back-end developer in a consulting firm. I started to work as part of a team for the first time. Everything was new to me. I learned agile, sprint, scrum, and many topics that I hadn&rsquo;t heard of before. I mainly developed a CRUD system with a REST API, and I was getting good at it. Little did I know, there was so much more to learn in the software development world. That&rsquo;s right, I had reached the peak of &lsquo;Mt. Stupid.&rsquo;</p>
<h3 id="valley-of-despair">Valley of Despair</h3>
<p>I noticed that the work I delivered to customers or even managers was very hard to debug and very unstructured, which also made it hard to modify, improve, or fix. I often had to rewrite whole modules from scratch. I didn&rsquo;t have many friends to talk with or ask how I could improve because everyone in the company was also at a junior level, and the manager didn&rsquo;t have much time to nitpick our work. So, I started looking elsewhere to satisfy my curiosity—a place where I could both work and learn how to &rsquo;engineer software,&rsquo; not just develop it.</p>
<h3 id="tdd-ddd-eda">TDD, DDD, EDA</h3>
<p>After almost a year at the consulting firm, I finally found a new place to work. This time, it was a corporate company with its own product, and I worked as part of a team to develop an application to help maintain this product for customers.</p>
<p>This place introduced me to domain-driven design philosophy, and I started to write code more beautifully. I learned how to engineer programs cleanly, implemented test-driven development in real work, and learned the powerful concept of event-driven architecture, which helps decouple many parts of the program, making it easier to scale or debug.</p>
<p>I am so happy that I chose to join this place.</p>
<h3 id="a-long-way-ahead">A Long Way Ahead</h3>
<p>My journey as a software engineer has just begun. There is so much left to learn, and I am eager to do so. I created this blog to share my experiences with others and for myself as well. Until next time.</p>
